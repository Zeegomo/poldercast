/**
# Overview

Poldercast is a multilayer based topology builder. It helps interconnect nodes
in a peer to peer decentralized way. This _crate_ does not do the connection part.
It only provides a way to construct the topology and how to communicate between
nodes.

This `crate` has been implemented based on the work Vinay Setty, Maarten van Steen,
Roman Vitenberg and Spyros Voulgaris: [PolderCast: Fast, Robust and Scalable
Architecture for P2P Topic-based Pub/Sub](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01555561).
However there are some slight differences in order to adapt the protocol based on
the needs.
